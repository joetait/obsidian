## General notes and thoughts
Finished the [[Invisible women]] book. Really thought provoking. Loads of detail, so will take a while to digest, but perhaps the main thing to take is to be conscious of whether or not I have a gendered response to people, and value what they say differently. And making sure to give women a chance to speak and represent themselves whenever possible (hopefully doing this anyway, but being more aware of times when I may not).

Was good to catch up with Michelle yesterday. Need to see her on my terms, as she will prioritise her things if needed. 

Bought two female authoured books from October Books - could be good to Dan's idea and only read female written literature for a period of time.

## Dump
- [ ]  Look up boards games on Shut Up, Sit Down
