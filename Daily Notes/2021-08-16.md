- [ ]  **Reflect on your past self.** Carve out some time to think about how much you have changed in the past few years. For instance, think about who you were three years ago. What kinds of activities did you like to do? What type of work did you enjoy the most? Who were your closest friends? Then, think about who you are right now. Have your hobbies, work priorities, or friendships changed? Spending some time with our past selves can foster the right mindset  to think about how we might change in the future. #selfImprovement #selfReflection
- [ ] **Imagine your ideal future self.** Just like you might do for your business, consider writing a vision statement for yourself.  A personal vision statement is an opportunity to consider what you really want in the future. Ask yourself questions such as: What will your typical day look like? What will your work environment look like? What kinds of clients do you want to work with? How much money do you want to make? Do not focus only on areas of your life you deem important today; try to explore areas that don’t seem as crucial to your present self, but may be central to the life of your future self. For instance, you may not be in a relationship, have kids, run a company, or speak another language today — what about your future self? Once you have a vision statement written down, you can start making plans for making those goals happen. #selfImprovement #selfReflection
