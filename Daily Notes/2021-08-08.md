## General notes and thoughts
Were at Sophie's mum's place, from having stayed over the day before. Plenty of time in the morning to sort ourselves out. We played with Lily and Stanley in the morning, then after Sophie's mum dropped them off at the train station we went with to take Charlie to work, and then on to Dorchester. 

Felt very unrushed and like we had plenty of time. We went to the loungers there for breakfast. I was half tempted to get something alcholic to have with, but decided not to. Good food, and then we headed up for the [[Vegan festival]] (only a few minutes away). Sophie's mum got/signed up to lots of bits. We got some good doughnuts, and discovered that there is a  monthly vegan festival in [[Brockenhurst]] on third Sunday of the month.

Got train back and had a chilled evening in.
