# Habits

#### Three Types of Habits
Potential idea - three types of habits, each of which can be approached differently 
- Replacement habits - replacing one habit with another
-  New habits - Developing completely new practices or habits
-  Breaking habits - Actively stopping doing something. Consider that this might often be easier if the action is replaced by something specific

The idea that some habits are changes that replace current actions, whereas as some habits are congruent l completely new, adding time to day.
Related - some habits will need upfront research, and also some will be fixed term rather than permanent
Could be a habit to stop doing something - how to best do this? Is it harder? Frame positively?
